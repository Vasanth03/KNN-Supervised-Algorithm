# KNN-Supervised-Algorithm
A KNN model is built to classify the animals in the national Zoo park based on different attributes.
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
2.  It is a non-parametric algorithm, meaning it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. Instead, it classifies new instances based on their similarity to the training instances.

Here's how the KNN algorithm works:

> **Data Preparation**: First, you need to have a labeled dataset with features and corresponding class labels or target values. Ensure the data is preprocessed, normalized, and scaled appropriately if needed.

> **Choosing the Value of K**: K in KNN represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider for classification. You need to choose an appropriate value for K. A smaller K value will make the decision boundary more sensitive to noise, while a larger K value may lead to oversmoothing.

> **Calculate Distances**: The algorithm calculates the distance between the new instance (to be classified) and all the instances in the training set. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski distance.

> **Find K Neighbors**: The algorithm selects the K instances with the smallest distances to the new instance. These instances are the "nearest neighbors" of the new instance.

> **Majority Voting**: For classification tasks, the algorithm determines the class label for the new instance by majority voting. It assigns the class label that is most frequent among the K nearest neighbors. In the case of regression tasks, it takes the average of the target values of the K nearest neighbors.

> **Prediction**: Once the class label or target value is determined, the algorithm assigns it to the new instance.

> **Evaluate Performance**: Finally, you can evaluate the performance of the KNN algorithm using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error, depending on the task at hand.
